# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. It has two latte recipe videos, a menu, reservation form that submits reservations, contains hours of operations, and provides a coffee shop address. If you enjoy coffee as much as I do, this will make your coffee run a lot simpler!

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Organize layout utilizing flexbox, add animation, and correctly separate blocks into a BEM file structure. In the future, I'd like to implement a shopping cart where you can submit to go orders for pick-up.
